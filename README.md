# Task-7

# Basic Sales Summary using SQLite and Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use SQL inside Python to analyze simple sales data stored in a SQLite database. The project calculates total quantity sold and total revenue for each product and visualizes the results using a bar chart.

---

## Objectives

* Connect to a SQLite database using Python
* Create and populate a sales table
* Run SQL queries using Python
* Calculate total quantity and revenue using SQL aggregation
* Display results using print statements
* Visualize revenue using a bar chart

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* SQLite (sqlite3 module)
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

---

## Database Information

Database Name:
`sales_data.db`

Table Name:
`sales`

Table Structure:

| Column   | Type    | Description    |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| id       | INTEGER | Primary Key    |
| product  | TEXT    | Product name   |
| quantity | INTEGER | Quantity sold  |
| price    | REAL    | Price per unit |

---

## SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
```

---

## Features Implemented

* Created SQLite database using Python
* Created sales table
* Inserted sample sales data
* Executed SQL query using sqlite3
* Loaded SQL results into pandas DataFrame
* Printed sales summary
* Generated revenue bar chart using matplotlib

---

## Output Example

Sales Summary Table:

| Product | Total Quantity | Revenue |
| ------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Laptop  | 8              | 406000  |
| Mobile  | 14             | 294000  |
| Tablet  | 13             | 189000  |

Bar Chart:

* Displays revenue generated by each product

---

## Key Insights

* Laptop generated the highest revenue
* Mobile had the highest quantity sold
* SQL aggregation functions help summarize sales data efficiently
* Visualization makes comparison easier

---

## Files Included

* sales_data.db
* Python Script / Notebook
* README.md

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be combined to analyze sales data. SQLite provides a lightweight database solution, while pandas and matplotlib help in analyzing and visualizing the data effectively.
